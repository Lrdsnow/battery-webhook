# Battery Webhook
Send your battery info to popular services using webhooks!

## Usage
Install and run, then configure in the Settings page:

<img src="img/app.png" alt="alt text" title="image Title" width="250"/>
<br><br>

Once that's done, you can manually send the battery info to your configured webhook:

<img src="img/output.png" alt="alt text" title="image Title" width="350"/>
