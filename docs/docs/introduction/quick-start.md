# Quick Start

Open the Battery Webhook app, then go to **Settings**. Ensure the **Webhook Service Type** is set to whatever your webhook corresponds to, then paste the URL into the webhook URL text field.

You can fill out the additional fields if desired, and maybe check out [Setting up automations](../supported-services/discord/setting-up-automations.md).
