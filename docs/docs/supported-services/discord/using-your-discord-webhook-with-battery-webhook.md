description: A basic configuration of Battery Webhook

# Using your Discord webhook with Battery Webhook

Open the Battery Webhook app, then go to **Settings**. Ensure the **Webhook Service Type** is set to **Discord**, then paste the URL into the text field labeled **Discord Webhook URL**. Next, type any unique name you'd like into the **Display Name field**. This gives you a way to identify yourself on the webhook.

Once you're done, it should look like this:

### Testing it out

Back out of **Settings**, then go into **Home**. Then tap **Send Battery Info Now**. This button is how you manually send battery info at any time.

Once you see a success message stating "The battery info was sent", you'll see the following in the Discord channel you configured your webhook to post to:

This covers the basic usage of Battery Webhook!

It can get better from here, though/
