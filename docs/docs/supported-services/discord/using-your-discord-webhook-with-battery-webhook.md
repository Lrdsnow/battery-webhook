description: A basic configuration of Battery Webhook

# Using your Discord webhook with Battery Webhook

Open the Battery Webhook app, then go to **Settings**. Ensure the **Webhook Service Type** is set to **Discord**, then paste the URL you got in the last page into the text field labeled **Discord Webhook URL**.&#x20;

Next, type any unique name you'd like into the **Display Name field**. This gives you a way to identify yourself on the webhook, in the case of multiple people using it.

Once you're done, it should look like this:

### Testing it out

Back out of **Settings**, then go into **Home**. Then tap **Send Battery Info Now**. This button is how you manually send battery info at any time.

Once you see a success message saying, "The battery info was sent", you'll see the following in the Discord channel you configured your webhook to post to:

This covers the basic usage of Battery Webhook!

It can get better from here, though. Check out [Further configuring Battery Webhook](further-configuring-battery-webhook.md) to learn more about all of Battery Webhook's options or skip to [Setting up automations](setting-up-automations.md) to learn how to automate sending of battery info!
