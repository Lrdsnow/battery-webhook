description: How to create and configure a Discord Webhook

# Discord

If you already have a Discord webhook URL provided to you (such as one for a public channel), skip to [Using your webhook with Battery Webhook](using-your-discord-webhook-with-battery-webhook.md). Otherwise, read on.

***

To begin, you'll want to make sure that you have administrative access (or server edit permissions) to a Discord server containing a channel you would like to push to.

Then, open Discord and head to the server you want to push to.

Open **Server Settings** and open the **Integrations** tab. Then click **Create Webhook,** or if it says **View Webhooks** then click that and then click **Create Webhook.**

With the webhook created, you can now configure it. You can change its avatar, name, and the channel that it posts to. Once these are configured to your liking, click **Copy Webhook URL**.

This is the URL that you'll provide to Battery Webhook, so save it somewhere that you can copy+paste from on the device that will be running Battery Webhook.
