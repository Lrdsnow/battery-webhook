# Further configuring Battery Webhook

You'll notice that the **Settings** page in Battery Webhook has a few options we didn't cover in the last page!

**Avatar Image URL** allows you to provide a custom image to the webhook to be shown with your display name. If none is provided, Battery Webhook will provide a Discord-provided generic avatar image. You can get the avatar image URL for your Discord account using Discord bots like Tatsumaki or CorpBot.

**Pronoun** is where you provide a singular pronoun for yourself, and Battery Webhook uses it for automations. For example, if you provide **her** as your pronoun, Battery Webhook will say "\[name] plugged in **her** iPhone".

**Device Name** is where you can customize the name of your device. Battery Webhook pulls the device name automatically, but it can still be customized.

***

**Show specified avatar image** and **Show specified pronoun** control whether Battery Webhook will send the avatar image/pronoun to the webhook.

**Send Device Name** and **Send Device Model** will control whether Battery Webhook will send your device's name/model to the webhook. These can be disabled if you would like greater privacy.
